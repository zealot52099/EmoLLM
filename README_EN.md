The Model aims to fully understand and promote the mental health of individuals, groups, and society. This model typically includes the following key components:

-  Cognitive factors: Involving an individual's thought patterns, belief systems, cognitive biases, and problem-solving abilities. Cognitive factors significantly impact mental health as they affect how individuals interpret and respond to life events.
- Emotional factors: Including emotion regulation, emotional expression, and emotional experiences. Emotional health is a crucial part of mental health, involving how individuals manage and express their emotions and how they recover from negative emotions.
- Behavioral factors: Concerning an individual's behavior patterns, habits, and coping strategies. This includes stress management skills, social skills, and self-efficacy, which is the confidence in one's abilities.
- Social environment: Comprising external factors such as family, work, community, and cultural background, which have direct and indirect impacts on an individual's mental health.
- Physical health: There is a close relationship between physical and mental health. Good physical health can promote mental health and vice versa.
- Psychological resilience: Refers to an individual's ability to recover from adversity and adapt. Those with strong psychological resilience can bounce back from challenges and learn and grow from them.
- Prevention and intervention measures: The Mental Health Grand Model also includes strategies for preventing psychological issues and promoting mental health, such as psychological education, counseling, therapy, and social support systems.
- Assessment and diagnostic tools: Effective promotion of mental health requires scientific tools to assess individuals' psychological states and diagnose potential psychological issues.
